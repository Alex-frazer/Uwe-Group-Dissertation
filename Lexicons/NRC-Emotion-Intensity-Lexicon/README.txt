I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------

The NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon (version 1) is a list of English words with real-valued
scores of intensity for eight categorical emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise, and trust). (Note that an earlier version of the lexicon (v0.5)
included intensity scores for four categorical emotions: anger, fear, sadness, joy.)

Words can be associated with different intensities (or degrees) of an emotion.  For
example, most people will agree that the word condemn is associated with a greater degree
of anger (or more anger) than the word irritate. However, annotating instances for
fine-grained degrees of affect is a substantially more difficult undertaking than
categorical annotation: respondents are presented with greater cognitive load and it is
particularly hard to ensure consistency (both across responses by different annotators and
within the responses produced by the same annotator). Here, for the first time, we create
an affect intensity lexicon with real-valued scores of association using best--worst
scaling.

For a given word and emotion X, the scores range from 0 to 1. A score of 1 means that the
word conveys the highest amount of emotion X.  A score of 0 means that the word conveys
the lowest amount of emotion X.

The lexicon has close to 10,000 entries for eight emotions that Robert Plutchik argued to
be basic or universal.  It includes common English terms as well as terms that are more
prominent in social media platforms, such as Twitter. It includes terms that are
associated with emotions to various degrees. For a given emotion, this even includes some
terms that may not predominantly convey that emotion (or that convey an antonymous
emotion), and yet tend to co-occur with terms that do.  (Antonymous terms tend to co-occur
with each other more often than chance, and are particularly problematic when one uses
automatic co-occurrence-based statistical methods to capture word--emotion connotations.)

THE RELATIONSHIP OF NRC-EIL WITH THE NRC EMOTION LEXICON 
The NRC Emotion Lexicon provides binary scores (0 or 1) indicating whether a word is
associated with a categorical emotion or not. The NRC-EIL includes all the words that are marked
as associated with an emotion in the NRC Emotion Lexicon. Notably, NRC-EIL provides for
these words a score indicative of the intensity of emotion. Note that the NRC-EIL also
includes some words that do not occur in the NRC Emotion Lexicon.

Applications: The lexicon has a broad range of applications in Computational Linguistics, Psychology,
Digital Humanities, Computational Social Sciences, and beyond. Notably it can be used to:
- study how people use words to convey emotions.
- study how emotions are conveyed through literature, stories, and characters.
- obtain features for machine learning systems in sentiment, emotion, and other affect-related tasks and
  to create emotion-aware word embeddings and emotion-aware sentence representations.
- evaluate automatic methods of determining emotion intensities (using lexicon entries as gold/reference scores).
- study psychological models of emotions.
- study the role of highly emotional words in emotional sentences, tweets, snippets from literature.

This study was approved by the NRC Research Ethics Board (NRC-REB) under protocol number
2017-98. REB review seeks to ensure that research projects involving humans as
participants meet Canadian standards of ethics.

III. PYTHON CODE TO ANALYZE EMOTIONS IN TEXT
--------------------------------------------

There are many third party software packages that can be used in conjunction with the NRC
Emotion Intensity Lexicon to analyze emotion word use in text. We recommend Emotion Dynamics:

	https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics

It is also the primary package that we use to analyze text using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and
the NRC VAD Lexicon.  It can be used to generate a csv file with a number of emotion
features pertaining to the text of interest, including metrics of utterance emotion
dynamics.

See this paper for an example of the use of the lexicon to analyze emotions in text:

	Evaluation Conference (LREC-2022), May 2022, Marseille, France.

IV. NRC-EIL IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES
--------------------------------

Despite some cultural differences, it has been shown that a majority of affective norms
are stable across languages. Thus we provide versions of the emotion intensity lexicon in
over one hundred languages by translating the English terms using Google Translate (August
2022). 

The lexicon is thus available for English and these languages:

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali,
Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chichewa, Corsican, Croatian, Czech,
Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Frisian, Gaelic, Galician,
Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, HaitianCreole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada,
Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurmanji, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian,
Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian,
Samoan, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Simplified, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian,
Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai,
Traditional, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukranian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa,
Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

Note that an earlier version included translations obtained in 2018. The current 2022
translations are markedly better. That said, some of the translations are still incorrect
or they may simply be transliterations of the original English terms.


V. LEMMATIZATION AND OTHER TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL
------------------------------------------------------------

The lexicon file can be used as is, but occasionally certain additional techniques can be
applied to make the most of it for one's specific application context.

1. LEMMATIZATION: The lexicon largely includes the base forms or lemmas of words. For
example, it may include an entry for 'attack', but not for 'attacks' or 'attacking'. In
many cases, such morphological variants are expected to have similar emotion scores. So
one can first apply a third-party lemmatizer on the target text to determine the base forms
before applying the lexicon. Note that lemmatization must be applied with care; for
example, while it it good to go from 'helplessness' to 'helpless' (they are expected to
have similar emotional connotations), 'helplessness' should not be lemmatized to 'help'
(they are expected to have markedly different emotional connotations). Further, various
factors such as tense and 'differing predominant senses for different morphological forms'
can impact emotionality. So benefits of lemmatization are limited, especially when
analyzing large pieces of text.

2. For some applications it may be more suitable to treat low-intensity scores (below a
pre-chosen threshold) as 0.  There is no one universally ``correct'' threshold.  One can
determine the threshold suitable for their application by tuning on a development set.

3. OTHER: Other techniques such discarding highly ambiguous terms (terms with many
meanings), or identifying most common terms in one's text and inspecting emotion entries
in the lexicon for those terms (and correcting entries where appropriate), etc. are also
good practice.


VI. FORMS OF THE LEXICON, FILES, AND FORMAT
-------------------------------------------

1. NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt: This is the main lexicon file with entries for ~10K English words. 
It has three columns (separated by tabs):
- word: The English word for which emotion intensity scores is provided. 
(For each emotion, the words are listed in decreasing order of intensity.)
- emotion: The emotion for which the intensity score is provided.
- emotion-intensity-score: The emotion intensity score of the word.

2. The directory 'OneFilePerEmotion' has two sets of files.

The files with names <emotion>-NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt have the
same information as in NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt, but in multiple
files -- one for each emotion: for e.g.,
anger-NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt includes only anger intensity
scores.  The words are listed in decreasing order of intensity.

The files with names <emotion>-NRC-EmoIntv1-withZeroIntensityEntries.txt
include all the entries in <emotion>-NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt, but
additionally also include entries for words that have been marked as having no
association with the emotion. These words have intensity scores of 0. Note that
the words not included in these files have not been annotated for association
with the emotions, and so their emotion intensity score is unknown.

3. NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1-ForVariousLanguages.txt: This files has the same first
three columns as the NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt.  Additionally, it has columns
pertaining to over 100 languages. Each of these columns lists the translations of the
English words into the corresponding language. For example, the column Japanese contains
the Japanese translations of the English words.  The translations were obtained using
Google Translate in August 2022. 

4. The directory 'OneFilePerLanguage' has the same information as in
NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1-ForVariousLanguages.txt, but in multiple files -- one for
each language.  Each of these files has four columns. The first three columns are the same
as in the NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt.  Additionally, it has  a column for the
translation of the English words to a different language -- the language corresponding to
the file name.  So if one is interested only in the Japanese version of the NRC-EIL, then
they can simply use Japanese-NRC-Emotion-Intensity-Lexicon-v1.txt.

5. ListOfLanguages-For-Which-Lexicon-Availabale.txt: Lists the languages for which the
lexicon is available.

6. Paper-lrec2018-word-emotion.pdf: The research paper describing the NRC-EIL.

7. Paper-Practical-Ethical-Considerations-Lexicons.pdf: Practical and Ethical Considerations in the
Effective use of Emotion and Sentiment Lexicons

8. Paper-Ethics-Sheet-Emotion-Recognition.pdf: Ethics Sheet for Automatic Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis.


ENCODING: The lexicon files were created using UTF-8 encoding. You can view the lexicon files using
most text editors, Microsoft Excel, etc. You might have to make sure that the viewer
supports characters from various languages, i.e., set the encoding option in the viewer to
UTF-8, etc.  For example, to view in excel, follow these steps:

- open excel
- click on File -> Import
- select file type as 'Text file'
- select the lexicon file to import in the dialog box that opens up
- select 'File Origin' type as 'Unicode (UTF-8)'
- click 'Finish'


VII. VERSION INFORMATION AND CHANGE LOG
---------------------------------------

- Version 1 is the latest version (Released March 2020). An earlier version of the lexicon (v0.5)
included intensity scores for only four categorical emotions: anger, fear, sadness, joy.

- The automatic translations generated using Google Translate are updated every few years.
  They were last obtained in August 2022.

- The README was last updated in August 2022.

- August 2022: 71 informal terms were removed from the lexicon. 
  Background: The source words annotated in 2018 included a small number of terms
  extracted from tweets. Unfortunately, this also included some fairly
  non-standard terms such as thang, koo, garansi, and untuk. These terms have now
  been removed.


VIII. OTHER EMOTION LEXICONS 
----------------------------

- The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon includes a list of more than 20,000 English words and
their valence, arousal, and dominance scores.  For a given word and a dimension (V/A/D), the scores range from
0 (lowest V/A/D) to 1 (highest V/A/D).

- The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight categorical emotions
(anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative
and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing.

X. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------

Please see the papers below (included with the download) for ethical
considerations involved in automatic emotion detection and the use of emotion
lexicons. (These also act as the Ethics and Data Statements for the lexicon.)

- Ethics Sheet for Automatic Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis. 
Saif M. Mohammad. Computational Linguistics. 48 (2): 239â€“278. June 2022. 

- Practical and Ethical Considerations in the Effective use of Emotion and Sentiment Lexicons.
Saif M. Mohammad. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03492. December 2020. 

Note that the labels for words are *associations* (and not denotations). As noted in the
paper above, they are limited by when the dataset was annotated, by the people that
annotated them, historical perceptions, and biases. (See bullets c through h in the
paper). It is especially worth noting that identity terms, such as those referring to
groups of people may be particularly prone to inappropriate biases. Further, marginalized
groups have historically faced more negative perceptions. Thus some terms that are
associated with marginalized groups may be marked as having associations with negative
emotions by the annotators. For example, group X marked as being associated with negative
emotions could imply that they have historically faced negative emotions or that some
people have negative associations with group X, or there is some other reason for the
negative association. The exact relationship is not listed in the lexicon. In order to
avoid misinterpretation and misuse, and as recommended generally in the ethical
considerations paper, we have removed entries for a small number of terms (about 25) that
are associated with identity groups. For the vast majority of sentiment and emotion
analysis requirements this removal will likely have no impact or will be beneficial.

The list of identity terms used is taken from this list developed in 2019 on an offensive
language project (abusive language is often directed at some identity groups):

https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit/blob/main/Dataset/identityterms_group.txt

Only some of these terms occurred in our lexicon. This is not an exhaustive list; users
may choose to filter out additional terms for their particular task. We also welcome
requests for removal of additional terms from the list. Simply email us with the term or
terms and reason for removal.
