The virtue of Humility and Modesty and Moderation, will be regarded as being stupid, the Christian morality will be regarded as a Slave morality, and aggressive competition will be regarded as the highest virtue and a great success, while a new form or ethics and euphemism will always hide the truth. A form of social silence will slowly reign in Malta as a ferocious camouflaged Monster grows larger and larger in our Renzo Piano building fed by local contractors, as itself has a bankrupt mind of how to generate long term National wealth. And with all this in clear sight, the majority of the angels still smile while others at least did stopped smiling.
