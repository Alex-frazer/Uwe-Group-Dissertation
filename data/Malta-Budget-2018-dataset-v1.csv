The difference between the 2 parties is now clear ...Labour under Muscat has abandoned ideological consistency that was an important characteristic over decades since its foundation and is pursuing a populist policy . Boffa, Mintoff, KMB and Alfred Sant - all considered the Labour ideals as central in their policy-making whereas Joseph Muscat has no such scruples.

The PN on the other hand still adheres to nation building as its fundamental underlying principle . This means that Labour has temporary gained a big electoral advantage. However this advantage will not last forever since after a period of time the electorate will realise the short-termism of Labour's policies....booms are followed by bangs and hardship for an increasing minority of people in poverty or in the risk of poverty increases all the time.

It is important that in these new conditions the PN re-generates itself by showing that populism does not offer a solution to the country's problems .... and takes its message to all social classes.....especially to the south of Malta where Labour has built a formidable stronghold . At the same time the Party must try to form alliances with other social groups rather than trying to capture the absolute majority by itself - as it had succeeded to do in the 1980's and 1990's.

In this way, the PN by discarding elitism will offer an alternative government",1,neutral,sadness,0,0,1,1,0

However a pensioner in his 80's payed his NI on a government promise that he will receive 2/3 of his pay as pension, finding himself and his spouse depending on others, he has not only to fend for himself and his spouse with the 'same increase' as you ably put it.
