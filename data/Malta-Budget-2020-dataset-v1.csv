20200370,,,N-5-2020,"The root of the troubles of October 1979 and October 2017 is that the Labour Party has never fully abandoned point 6 of the the 6 points that were the bone of contention between the Labour Party and the Church in the 1960's. The 6th point reads as follows: ""6. F'certi kazi hi ammessa l-vjolenza"" (""6. In certain cases violence is permitted"") Source ""Ghad-demokrazija u l-helsien"" SKS 1989. In actual fact this tenet goes against the principles of a modern state, based on rule of law. So unless the Labour Party takes an unequivocal position, that in no circumstances will it resort to violence and that it will observe rule of law, Malta will not be able to build a modern state. I am not implying that the Labour Party- as such - is criminally responsible for Black Monday 1979 or Black Monday 2017, but unless the Labour Party acts as mentioned above, an adherent or adherents of the Labour Party will feel justified to act violently in pursuit of - what they believe to be - the aims of the Party. The parliamentary system can only be effective when the political parties deny to themselves the use of violence.
