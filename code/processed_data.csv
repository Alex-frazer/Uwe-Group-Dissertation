Also acquiring materials used in battery production is not exactly environmentally friendly as is the disposal of the batteries once they are no longer in service.","['entirely', 'convinced', 'electric', 'car', 'far', 'driven', 'one', 'dec', '##ent', 'drive', 'quite', 'powerful', 'quiet', 'need', 'char', '##ging', 'kilometre', 'think', 'petrol', 'diesel', 'car', 'km', 'also', 'expensive', 'battery', 'pack', 'use', 'thousand', 'standard', 'cell', 'like', 'lap', '##top', 'start', 'losing', 'capacity', 'year', 'replacement', 'cost', 'anything', 'euro', 'up', '##wards', 'also', 'ac', '##qui', '##ring', 'material', 'used', 'battery', 'production', 'exactly', 'environmental', '##ly', 'friendly', 'dis', '##posa', '##l', 'battery', 'longer', 'service']","[101, 33709, 66918, 15988, 12485, 12218, 35729, 10399, 32937, 11604, 15834, 29977, 27632, 48313, 15415, 55804, 14094, 56656, 21506, 76396, 26009, 12485, 10166, 10398, 53936, 34794, 34651, 11868, 29808, 13145, 16931, 11531, 13843, 33876, 13982, 25909, 22404, 10817, 38430, 18153, 32527, 13893, 10700, 45113, 10398, 12181, 27776, 13243, 13220, 11173, 34794, 11961, 56938, 21199, 10563, 35751, 23145, 58978, 10159, 34794, 19971, 11416, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.04918032786885246,0.34936430170887806,1.3324325468332585,0.4936801,0.9498192667961121,0.3471687436103821,3.0

The difference between the 2 parties is now clear ...Labour under Muscat has abandoned ideological consistency that was an important characteristic over decades since its foundation and is pursuing a populist policy . Boffa, Mintoff, KMB and Alfred Sant - all considered the Labour ideals as central in their policy-making whereas Joseph Muscat has no such scruples.

The PN on the other hand still adheres to nation building as its fundamental underlying principle . This means that Labour has temporary gained a big electoral advantage. However this advantage will not last forever since after a period of time the electorate will realise the short-termism of Labour's policies....booms are followed by bangs and hardship for an increasing minority of people in poverty or in the risk of poverty increases all the time.

It is important that in these new conditions the PN re-generates itself by showing that populism does not offer a solution to the country's problems .... and takes its message to all social classes.....especially to the south of Malta where Labour has built a formidable stronghold . At the same time the Party must try to form alliances with other social groups rather than trying to capture the absolute majority by itself - as it had succeeded to do in the 1980's and 1990's.

In order for the government to sustain an aging population he has invested in sectors that heavily rely on younger workers and in order to maintain a competitive advantage he is getting cheap labour from abroad. this means that he can sustain imminent pensions but in the mean time, the housing & rents sky rocketed in such a ways that no one affords them and wages have remained untouched if not worsened due to cheap labour. Hence we are getting paid less with no chance of finding accommodation and with very hazy pension schemes for our future. Banks have decreased credit rates to keep cash flow within the population in order to sustain spending due to the risen cost living and housing inflation. There is no possible means for us to save up money or buy property cause interest rates are the lowest ever held in order to sustain these credit loans for the increased property prices. Is this what we call success?","['think', 'people', 'living', 'parallel', 'universe', 'way', 'see', 'future', 'order', 'government', 'sus', '##tain', 'ag', '##ing', 'population', 'in', '##vest', '##ed', 'sector', 'heavily', 're', '##ly', 'younger', 'worker', 'order', 'maintain', 'competitive', 'advantage', 'getting', 'cheap', 'labour', 'abroad', 'mean', 'sus', '##tain', 'im', '##minen', '##t', 'pension', 'mean', 'time', 'housing', 'rent', 'sky', 'rocket', '##ed', 'way', 'one', 'af', '##ford', '##s', 'wage', 'remained', 'un', '##tou', '##ched', 'worse', '##ned', 'due', 'cheap', 'labour', 'hence', 'getting', 'paid', 'less', 'chance', 'finding', 'accommodation', 'haz', '##y', 'pension', 'scheme', 'future', 'bank', 'decreased', 'credit', 'rate', 'keep', 'cash', 'flow', 'within', 'population', 'order', 'sus', '##tain', 'spending', 'due', 'rise', '##n', 'cost', 'living', 'housing', 'inflation', 'possible', 'mean', 'u', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'property', 'interest', 'rate', 'lowest', 'ever', 'held', 'order', 'sus', '##tain', 'credit', 'loan', 'increased', 'property', 'price', 'call', 'success']","[101, 21506, 11227, 13623, 22340, 22092, 12140, 11811, 14299, 11970, 11594, 10877, 41722, 13353, 10285, 10509, 10104, 39368, 10390, 16838, 33043, 11449, 10563, 24392, 48695, 11970, 36518, 44133, 35867, 27948, 78026, 19913, 42570, 25659, 10877, 41722, 10205, 27718, 10123, 45501, 25659, 10573, 20183, 46057, 13724, 32423, 10390, 12140, 10399, 10513, 13172, 10107, 83638, 16353, 10119, 22016, 41765, 84705, 19803, 10875, 78026, 19913, 44122, 27948, 25033, 15095, 20035, 33570, 94613, 52338, 10158, 45501, 32453, 14299, 12638, 85526, 23814, 17593, 19311, 26509, 21752, 12325, 10509, 11970, 10877, 41722, 47882, 10875, 17434, 10115, 18153, 13623, 20183, 71132, 14312, 25659, 163, 21343, 15033, 102]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.008695652173913044,0.0,0.008695652173913044,0.06086956521739131,0.34547914098138394,1.3883700511810226,0.49204838,0.8116269111633301,0.31145453453063965,5.0

Then this government with his liberal policy have created hardship for those people who don't own a house and have to rent or buy a place to stay because of the exaggerated rent being asked which in most cases is more than the people renting these homes earn while our kids can't afford to buy a home as the prices asked are sky high and the most expensive in Europe while our salaries are the lowest.

They are very expensive and unreliable such that they will render a car into scrap within 5 years against the standard 10 of today's cars, do we have plans for recycling - not really as the most toxic components have very little to recycle. And to run, not really cheaper cause as soon as you are going to start charging your car, you will be running into the most expensive electricity band.

A used Nissan leaf is €10k. That's cheaper than a Toyota Vitz. And don't tell me the battery is expensive, you'll probably upgrade the car before you need a new battery, and even if you do change it you'll more than make up for it over they years by spending much less on electricity than you do now on petrol, and spending much less on services since there's no engine oil, filters or spark plugs to change. Also, you can keep using your old car as long as you want. The law will only ban imports of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars.

Earth-shaking news. The Prof. has gone to the President to have the budget signed. The submissive and subjugated Maltese people are biting their nails, unable to wait to discover what wonderful gifts the Brussels reject will bestow on them paid by their own tax-money. To this level of grovelling slaves have the people been reduced.

Hence that's why it's not easy to raise the wages.","['country', 'like', 'wage', 'rise', 'limited', 'small', 'country', 'give', 'rise', 'side', 'effect', 'sure', 'like', 'forget', 'pay', '##rise', 'case', 'ad', '##jus', '##tment', 'previous', 'year', 'inflation', 'service', 'local', 'product', 'effect', 'rise', 'price', 'plus', 'another', 'side', 'effect', 'malta', 'wage', 'like', 'concerti', '##na', 'give', 'one', 'euro', 'one', 'scale', 'go', 'scale', 'know', 'mean', 'government', 'fork', 'every', 'year', 'billion', 'euro', 'small', 'country', 'like', 'huge', 'burden', 'carry', 'hence', 'easy', 'raise', 'wage']","[101, 11913, 11531, 83638, 17434, 14868, 11871, 11913, 16118, 17434, 12029, 17400, 26210, 11531, 58884, 11498, 34890, 12700, 10816, 30090, 91950, 16821, 10817, 71132, 11416, 11467, 20058, 17400, 17434, 16993, 10608, 12162, 12029, 17400, 22821, 83638, 11531, 67524, 10206, 16118, 10399, 13893, 10399, 17216, 11335, 17216, 16332, 25659, 11594, 27101, 13667, 10817, 24382, 13893, 11871, 11913, 11531, 37985, 79762, 26913, 44122, 24806, 36208, 83638, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,7.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.06349206349206349,0.1111111111111111,0.32900498854735544,1.2665319407509268,0.49390507,0.9108997583389282,0.3107506036758423,12.0

How will liquid foods like cooking oil, tomato ketchup, vinegar, water etc be sold? How will cleaning materials like floor liquid, fabric softener etc be sold? If there is a way, so much the better. Possibly, importers will resort to glass which is more expensive because it weighs more and costs more to transport.
